Dear Tournament Organizer and/or Chief Official(s) --

The post-tournament reports from 10C057C CASS-CAWS Kick off Classic
05-23-2010 have not yet been posted in the Sanction control system.

It has now been [x] weeks since the above-referenced event was 
scheduled to take place, according to our records.  If the 
competition did NOT actually take place as planned, then please 
advise us so that we can revise the status of your tournament in 
the Sanction control system.

However, if the competition DID run as planned, then you need to 
get the post-tournament reports in soon.  The WSTIMS Zip file 
should be emailed to [seeding rep name], your Regional seeding 
committee representative, who is copied herein.  If you are 
having difficulty producing any of those reports, or the Zip
file itself, please contact [FirstNm] for assistance.

You need to be aware that any subsequent sanction applications for 
your organization cannot be approved, until these missing reports
have been received and checked off.  ( include only if 6+ wks )

Thank you for your hard work and continued support,

Traci Baylon

While some of the required reports have been received and checked
off, the following items are still marked outstanding as of today:

	[ list of specific items ]

If these missing items have been mailed in the past few days and
this eMail is crossing your package in the mail, please disregard 
this notice.  Otherwise, please note that it has now been [x] weeks 
since the above-referenced event took place, and these missing items 
need to be submitted soon. 

You need to be aware that any subsequent sanction applications for 
your organization cannot be approved, until these missing reports

Electronic submission of these items to your Regional seeding
