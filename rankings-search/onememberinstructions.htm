Registration Template Spreadsheet</b></font></p>

<p>This window provides detailed instructions on how to add a new participant
to an existing Registration Template spreadsheet, by copying the information 
about that member which is displayed in the <font color="red"><b>USA Water Ski 
Registration Details</b></font> window.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; First you will need to insert a blank row into your 
Registration Template Spreadsheet, at the location where you wish to add 
this additional participant.&nbsp; This is easiest done by <b>RIGHT</b> 
clicking the row number (at the far left side of the Excel window), and
then clicking on <b>INSERT</b> in the pop-up menu.&nbsp; That will insert
an additional row at that location, and shift all the other participants 
down one row.&nbsp; Now you're ready to copy the information for your
additional participant into that new row in your spreadsheet.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the <b>USA Water Ski Registration Details</b> 
window, and you will find that the information on your new participant is 
presented in two or more separate sections.&nbsp; You will need to copy 
<b>each</b> of those strings of information into separate sets of columns 
in your Registration Template spreadsheet.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first information box displays the member's number,
name, age, division, city and state.&nbsp; This information needs to go 
into columns <b>A</b> through <b>H</b> in your spreadsheet.&nbsp;
Highlight that string of values in that upper information box, then 
<b>RIGHT</b> click on that highlighted line, and choose "Copy" from the 
pop-up menu, to put this info onto your windows clipboard.&nbsp; Next you
need to switch over to your Excel window with the Registration Template 
Spreadsheet.&nbsp; <b>RIGHT</b> click in the <b>A</b> column cell, in the 
row that you have just inserted for this additional participant, then click 
"Paste Special" in the pop-up menu, and then click the "As: Text" choice, 
and finally click the "OK" button.&nbsp; If you happen to use the normal 
paste function instead, you will find that will cram all the information 
into the column A cell alone.&nbsp; Never fear, you can merely use the 
Excel "UNDO" icon, and then try the paste again.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately below the Number/Name detail display box, the
website will report the participant's membership status, and whether they
are fully qualified to compete on the planned tournament date, or whether
they would need to renew or upgrade their membership before.&nbsp; That 
information may be copied into the <b>V-W-X</b> columns on this participant's
added row in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the Membership Status information line, the
display may then give you one or more strings of Ranking Score / Rating
information, for any Divisions where the participant has scores.&nbsp; If
there are no ranking scores, it will tell you that.&nbsp; If there is more
than one string reported, be sure you choose the appropriate Division(s)
and Ranking score(s), for the Division(s) that this participant is planning 
to compete in, at your competition.&nbsp; Highlight and copy that string
of values onto the clipboard, using the same process described in step #3 
above, and as above, use the <b>Paste Special (text)</b> process to paste 
that information at the <b>L</b> column cell in this participant's row 
in the spreadsheet, and that will paste the string into columns <b>L</b> 
through <b>R</b> on that row.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; After you copy all of the pertinent information for this
new participant into your Registration Template spreadsheet, then you can
click on the <b>New Search</b> button to continue to search for other 
additional participants in the same fashion, or else click the <b>Quit</b>
button to close out the search process.&nbsp; Of course, remember to save
your updated Registration Template spreadsheet, in the Excel format,
before you close the Excel window.</p>
