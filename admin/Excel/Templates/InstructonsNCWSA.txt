 Overview Information
 ==================== 
 
 
This NCWSA Registration Template has been pre-populated with most of 
the information you'll need to set up an NCWSA Tournament for scoring 
with WSTIMS.  It contains multiple sections, whose tabs can be seen 
at the lower left corner of the Excel window.  Click these tabs to 
move between the sections.

The four primary sections of this Excel workbook have all been filled 
in with the information supplied by the respective team captains, 
through the new NCWSA Online Registration system.  All of the 
pre-registered team skiers will be found in these four sections of 
the workbook.  The "All Other" section contains all other non-pre-
registered NCWSA team members, as well as other USA Water Ski members 
who might be participants at an NCWSA Tournament.
 
The vast majority of the prep work has already been done by the new 
NCWSA Online Team Registration System -- the captains will have used 
that system to prepare their respective Team Entry and Rotation 
Plans, and those details are all incorporated into this workbook. 
About all that the Registrar needs to do is to make any last minute 
changes that captains may show up with.

Here is a high-level outline of the steps you'll need to go through 
with this template, to prepare for your tournament.  More details on 
these steps can be found further down in these instructions ...
 
   (1)  Make any changes in the Rotation Numbers (Team Sequence 
        numbers, 1 thru 5) in the SL & TR & JP columns, to indicate 
        what rotation each skier will ski in.  A blank in a column 
        indicates that skier will not be competing in that event. 
        You do NOT need to remove or delete team members not skiing 
        -- WSTIMS will only pick up those with event entry codes 
        indicated. 
 
   (2)  If necessary to add a team member who was not pre-registered, 
        you should be able to find that person in the All Other 
        section of this workbook.  Most likely they will be found in 
        the team-coded skiers that appear at the top of that section, 
        or otherwise in the non-team-coded alphabetic list that 
        appears below those, for entirely new team members.  Just 
        copy and paste that additional row to the appropriate spot 
        for their team, in the Men's or Women's A or B team 
        section(s), and then fill in the rotation numbers for the
        specific events they will be skiing. 
 
   (3)  Chief and Appointed Officials listed in the Sanction system 
        for your tournament will appear as a separate "Officials" 
        team block, at the top of the Men (B tm) tab section.  Be 
        sure to add any Assistant Chief officials to that block, 
        along with their position codes.  Other volunteer officials 
        should also be added to that block.  See the Officials 
        Information section below for more details. 
 
   (4)  Once all of the team entry information is complete and 
        checked, then finally export each of the four sections to 
        text files, so they can be read by WSTIMS. Even if there are 
        no B teams skiing, be sure that you export the Men (B Team) 
        section, so that you can import the Officials information 
        that is contained in that section into WSTIMS.
 
 
 
 IMPORTANT DO's AND DON'Ts
 ========================= 
 
 
   DO ----- Check the Rotation numbers under the SL & TR & JP columns
            for each Team's roster.  Except for All Stars, no more 
            than 5 skiers per team should be indicated in any A team 
            event, and each of those must have a unique number.  You 
            can't have 2 from same team both coded "4", for example. 
            The online Team Rotation Planning system will have pre-
            validated the plans entered there by the respective team 
            captains -- but any changes made after this template was 
            downloaded should be checked to ensure that no duplicate 
            rotation sequences were inadvertently entered. 
 
   DON'T -- Tinker with the sizes or arrangement of the columns in 
            this Excel template -- WSTIMS expects to see the data 
            arranged in columns exactly as it's originally formatted 
            by the download -- keep it that way please. 
 
   DO ----- Keep the Men and Women skiers in their respective 
            separate sections.  WSTIMS expects to be given two 
            (or 4 if B teams are involved) entry lists. 
 
   DON'T -- Change the Team Codes.  The Team Headers included in this 
            template come from the NCWSA Master Team list, and it is 
            important that these be used, exactly as given.  If you 
            have a new Team that does not appear in this template,  
            please consult with your Regional NCWSA chairman to get 
            an official code assigned to this new team, then use 
            that code and create a new Team Header row. 
 
   DO ----- Ensure that you are using the latest version of WSTIMS. 
            The currently available version and date is cited on the  
            "Scoring" link you will find on the Waterski page of the 
            USA Water Ski website -- check that against what you 
            have installed on your scoring computer(s). 
 
   DO ----- Consult the remainder of this instruction material, if 
            you are not absolutely certain about any details.  A  
            quick look here, can save you tons of redo time later.  
            Details on a variety of topics are included here.  You  
            can click on topics in the Index section at the top of  
            this document, to take you directly to material on that  
            particular topic.  In addition, the WSTIMS User's Guide  
            has an NCWSA Casebook section, with details on how to  
            set up and score an NCWSA Tournament. 
 
 
 
 What's in this Excel Workbook
 ============================= 
 
 
The four primary sections of this Excel workbook -- Men (A Team), 
Women (A Team), Men (B Team) and Women (B Team) -- have all been 
filled in with the Team Entry and Rotation Plan information, that was 
input by the respective team captains through the new NCWSA Online 
Team Registration system.  All of the pre-registered team skiers will 
be found in these four sections of the workbook.

The "All Other" section contains all other non-pre-registered NCWSA 
team members, as well as other USA Water Ski members who might be 
participants at an NCWSA Tournament.  This includes anyone age 16-29, 
plus anyone who has declared NCWSA as either their primary or 
secondary sports division.

In addition, all of the Chief and Appointed officials for this 
tournament that are listed in the Sanction system, will also be 
included.  Those officials will appear as one block, at the top of 
the Men (B Team) section.  In addition to the skiers themselves, the 
information on these officials also needs to be imported into WSTIMS, 
so that they will be available for Officials recording in events.

If it becomes necessary to add a team member who was not pre-
registered, you should be able to find that person in the All Others 
section of this workbook.  Most likely they will be found in the 
team-coded skiers that appear at the top of that section, otherwise 
in the non-team-coded alphabetic list that appears below those, for 
entirely new team members.  Just copy and paste that additional row 
to the appropriate spot for their team, in the Men's or Women's A or 
B team section(s), and then fill in the rotation numbers for those 
events they will be skiing in.

The Online registration system will have validated the membership 
status for all pre-registered skiers.  But be sure to check the "Not 
Ready to Ski" information on any members you copy from this All 
Others section -- that will indicate any members whose membership is 
not of the appropriate type, or who are expired.  It is strongly 
recommended that such members visit the USA Water Ski website to 
rectify any membership status deficiencies.
 
The "Example" section of this workbook illustrates what a completed  
Men's entry list sections should look like, when you're ready to  
export the data to WSTIMS to set up for scoring.  In the A team Men 
or Women section, each team should look like the MSU example that 
appears at the top of that example section -- complete with the 
original team code and name, followed by all of that team's skiers. 
The B Team sections may also include separate special groups of 
Ineligible skiers and/or Officials.  Both of these latter groups 
should be coded with AWSA Age Division codes instead of CM or CW 
in the Age Div code column.  See Fall 2009 B Team Instructions. 
 
 
 
 Registration Management
 ======================= 
 
 
You should use the "Mem Status" and "Amt Paid" and "Amt Due" columns  
(columns O and rightwards) to keep track of this information for the  
skiers and for each team as a whole.  Essentially, you can use these  
areas in this workbook to help you manage your registration duties,  
and to keep track of other information that you may need.  Feel free  
to add other columns to the right for other purposes as you see fit.

Aside from dealing with verifying membership status on any skiers
that you copy across from the All Others section, you should review
the "Reason if Not ready to Ski" column in the four Entered Skiers
sections of your entries workbook.  Those who had not executed
the required Event Waiver online before you pulled your Registration
download, will be indicated as "Nds Evt Wvr" in that column.  You
should get these people to sign a paper Event Waiver form for you
at Registration.  If one or more of those skiers claim they did 
their waiver online (after you pulled your Registration template),
then if you have internet access, then you can review their waiver 
status through the Collegiate Registration tools.
 
As a prudent operating protocol, we encourage you to save this  
workbook periodically -- you don't want to chance losing your work. 
 
 
 
 Officials Information 
 ===================== 
 
 
The column Headed OFCL / DJCS contains four letter codes that  
indicates each member's Officials ratings as a Driver, Judge,  
Calculator (Scorer) and Safety Director.  The specific letter that  
appears in each of those four positions of the overall code,  
indicates the highest rating held in that officiating discipline,  
across the three events.  A hyphen (dash) is used where the member  
has no rating in the corresponding discipline.  Be sure to include  
all of your volunteer officials, either as AWSA skiers (in the B team  
section), or as non-skiers in the Mens A team section, below the  
teams and just above the END OF LIST marker.   
 
For input to WSTIMS, your Chief and Assistant Officials need to have 
their "Chief Code" entered in this column, where the rating codes 
would otherwise appear.  See the "Chief Codes" explanation in the 
WSTIMS User's Guide for more information on this subject.  All Chief 
and Appointed officials that are coded in the online Sanctioning 
system, will be included as a separate "Officials" team block, at the 
top of the Men (B tm) tab section.  Chief officials will be indicated 
by their appropriate Chief Code in the DJCS column.  If you have any 
Assistant Chief officials, be aware that those are not carried in the 
Sanction system, and so will need to be added to this block, and 
appropriately coded in the DJCS column. 
 
Other volunteer officials should also be added to this block.  If they 
have listed NCWSA as a primary or secondary sports division in their 
USA Waterski membership profile, then you should find them included 
in the All Others section of this template.  Otherwise you may 
need to use the lookup function on the website to get their details 
to paste into this template.  See the Adding Members to this template 
section below for details on how to do that. 
 
If officials will be skiing as AWSA skiers in your tournament, they  
would do so either with the B team skiers, or as an entirely separate 
group, as you may see fit.  In the latter case, then copy this block 
of officials to a separate section, and then export a separate entry 
list section for these folks, if you want to keep them separate from 
your other B team skiers. 
 
 
 
 B Teams -- New Information
 ========================== 
 
 
The B Team sections, both Men and Women, may contain up to three 
distinct sets of participants: 
 
   (1)  Full Time Eligible NCWSA skiers who are 6th position or 
        lower on their respective Team's Roster and hence not 
        able to ski as part of that school's A team.  These skiers 
        should have been entered by their captains and coded with 
        a B team Rotation selection.  That will result in their
        showing up in the respective B team section of your Excel
        workbook, and will be coded with the CM or CW division code. 
        Such skiers will have their performances included in the 
        NCWSA Rankings, but will not contribute to the A team 
        scoring for this tournament. 
 
   (2)  Part time, or 5th+ year, or first yr transfers, or otherwise 
        ineligible NCWSA skiers, who should not be included in the 
        NCWSA Rankings.  These skiers should be coded with their AWSA 
        Age Division codes of M1 or W1.  Such skiers should have been 
        entered by their captains with the Age Div rotation choice, 
        and will then appear with the B team skiers for their team, 
        but with the applicable Age Division code.
 
   (3)  Officials & AWSA Skiers.  All of your volunteer officials 
        should be included in the participant list, whether skiing 
        or not (see Officials Information above).  Those who will 
        be skiing should be included in the B team section, and 
        coded with their respective AWSA Age Division code in the 
        Age Division column.  The events in which they will ski  
        should be coded with a unique Rotation number, in the  
        applicable event column(s).  Whether skiing or not, all of  
        these officials should have either an Officials rating code 
        string or a Chief Code coded in the DJCS column, so that 
        they will be picked up into the Officials Master List. 
 
See the Example section of this template for an illustration of what 
a completed Men B Team entry list section might look like, including 
all three of the above groups. 
 
 
 
 Membership Status Information
 ============================= 
 
 
Each member's status is included in this template.  Those skiers 
found in the Men's and Women's A and B Team sections have already 
been  verified and are good to go as of the date of your tournament. 
The members found in the All Others section may show a number of 
membership deficiencies -- including those in supporting status, or 
whose previous active  membership has expired, or who may not yet 
have signed the Annual USA  Water Ski participation waiver.  If 
applicable, the amount required  for them to upgrade or renew their 
membership is also indicated. 
 
It is strongly recommended that members intending to participate who 
are found to have such deficiencies, visit the  USA Water Ski website 
to rectify those deficiencies. 
 
It is recommended that you pull this template as late as possible 
before your tournament, so that any last-minute membership activity 
by the team skiers will be reflected herein.  For any skiers showing 
up who are not good, if an internet connection is available, then have 
them enroll or upgrade or renew that way, rather than using paper 
forms and having to collect money and so on.  Plus online enrollment 
will give them their membership number immediately, which you can 
then enter into this template. 
 
 

 Sports Division Indicators 
 ========================== 
 
 
This template will show each member's declared Sports Division in 
column Q over to the right.  If a collegiate skier does NOT have  
NCWSA shown here, we would like you to encourage that participant to 
contact USA Waterski HQ and add NCWSA as either their primary or 
secondary Sports Division.  We recognize that some NCWSA skiers may 
also be AWSA competitors during the summer, or ski for an NSSA show 
club -- but in those instances they can -- and should -- list NCWSA 
as their second preference.  NCWSA needs to be sure that all of our 
Collegiate skiing participants are properly indicated in the USA 
Waterski membership system.  Pls help us in this effort.  Thanx !! 
 
 

 Adding Members to this Template 
 ============================== 
 
 
If you have an internet connection available, and you have a skier 
who is not included in your Registration template, yet who you have  
reason to believe may now be in the USA Waterski membership system, 
you can use the "Lookup Individual Members" function on the website. 
That feature can be found in the same admin area from which you  
originally downloaded this Registration Template.  Use the Sanction 
ID and Edit Code to sign on there. 
 
If you have any AWSA skiers (officials), or non-skiing officials 
that will be participating, you should add those people to this 
template.  Non-Skiing officials should be included in the Men (B 
Team) section, with their applicable age division code. 
 
If you are copying such folks from an AWSA entry list, be aware that 
the arrangement of the columns in the AWSA Registration template is 
a bit different from this NCWSA format, and so be sure you only copy 
columns A-L (through the officials DJCS column), and leave out the 
the ranking list scores and ranking levels columns that you'll find 
in the AWSA template, or in the lookup area on the website. 
 
If you are adding a skier who is enrolling on the spot using a paper 
membership enrollment form, then you will not have a membership 
number for that person.  Make up a "dummy" number, in the form 
000-00-00xx, where the xx at the end are any two numeric digits -- 
WSTIMS will accept such dummy numbers in a pinch.  Any such added 
dummy numbers need to be unique across the entire entry template, 
so be careful -- duplication will lead to grief later. 
 
Discourage teams and skiers from planning to do their membership  
enrollment on-site -- having them go to the www.usawaterski.org  
website is much easier, and will get them their official membership  
card and member number in advance of the tournament -- and make your  
job easier. 
 
 

 Exporting your Entry Lists 
 ========================== 
 
 
This sections explains how to export the WSTIMS "Entry Lists" from  
this workbook, to feed these entry details into the WSTIMS scoring  
program. 
 
Before producing these extracts, there are two important steps that  
you should have carried out beforehand.  First, you should be sure to  
save the entire workbook, in its native Excel format.  Second, you  
should have already started the WSTIMS system and set up the new  
Directory (folder) for the tournament.  You will need to export your  
entry lists into that specific path, so that WSTIMS can find them.  
that folder will typically be located at C:\WSTIMS\[folder].  If the  
registration workbook is being processed on a different computer  
(separate from the one where the scoring will be done), then these  
extracts can be put onto a floppy disk instead, and then later copied  
onto the scoring computer. 
 
You will need to produce a separate entry list extract from each of  
the Men (A Team) and Women (A Team) sections of this workbook. If you  
have B teams as well, then those two sections should also be  
extracted as well.  Repeat the following steps below, for each  
section that you need to export -- each extract file will only  
contain one section from a multi-section workbook like this. 
 
For each extract, first click on the appropriate section tab at the  
bottom of the Excel window, then select the "File" and "Save As"  
choices from the menu bar at the top of the Excel window.  This will  
open up a standard Windows "Save As" dialog box. 
 
Once you've got that Save As dialog box up, you must first navigate 
to the C:\WSTIMS\[folder] for the tournament -- this is where the  
resulting extract file is to be placed.  Or navigate to the floppy  
disk instead, if your destination is on another computer. 
 
Next you must choose the appropriate "Save as Type" choice, from the  
drop-down list which appears in the box at the bottom of the Save As  
dialog box.  The choice you want is the "Formatted Text (Space  
Delimited)" option.  Please note that the list of choices is long,  
and this specific choice is located near the bottom of that list -- 
be sure you do NOT choose the "Text (Tab Delimited)" option which 
appears earlier in the list -- that one is NOT what you want. 
 
Next you need to specify a file name.  This file name must be no 
more than 8 characters long, and cannot contain any spaces or other  
punctuation, with the exception of a hyphen.  So you could use file  
names like "A-Men" and "A-Women" -- but not "Men's A team Entries".   
Do not specify a period and a qualifier for the file name -- the  
Formatted Text choice will automatically cause the extract file to  
be given the ".prn" type qualifier. 
 
Finally, click on the SAVE button at the bottom of that dialog box.   
That will extract the entry information, from that specific tab  
section of the workbook, into that designated file in the WSTIMS  
scoring folder.  When you click that "Save" button, you will then 
see one or two Excel dialog boxes come up, warning you that the  
.prn file type selected does not support multiple sheets, and may 
not support features included in your data -- in both cases select 
OK button to proceed anyways. 
 
Then repeat the above steps for each of the remaining sections of 
the workbook that you need to extract. 
 
After you have completed these extracts, it is important to note 
that the Excel title will now show only the last extract file name,  
rather than the name of the entire Excel workbook.  If you need to 
do any further work in the original workbook format, then it is 
important to close the Excel window, and then re-open the original 
workbook again.  Otherwise you could inadventently lose the other 
sections of the workbook, if you are not careful.  When you do close  
Excel after doing one or more of the above "Save As" processes, you 
will probably see a warning message that the last .prn file name has 
not been saved -- you can safely ignore this and choose the "No" 
option on that dialog box. 
 
 

 Potential Export Problem 
 ======================== 
 
 
!! NOTICE !!  Please be aware of one potential problem area in this  
process.  On rare occasions, an Excel user may find that their  
exported text-format entry list gets "Scrunched".  That is, each  
field in the sheet has been narrowed by one character position,  
resulting in the fields being lined up incorrectly. So if you should  
find yourself getting a lot of error messages when you process your  
entry list into WSTIMS, then this might be the underlying problem.  
 
To check, use the WSTIMS Edit a Text File task to examine your  
exported text.  If the data columns in that text file appear  
schrunched together -- for example the first letter of each member's  
last name is right next to their member number, instead of there  
being one space in between -- then this is your problem.  All other  
columns will likewise be narrower. 
 
Fortunately, our good friend Jeff Clark of Lakeland FL has recently  
helped identify the underlying cause of this problem, and happily  
this turns out to be pretty easy to fix. 
 
This results when a user has changed their Desktop Appearance setting  
from the normal 96 bpi font size, to the larger 120 bpi font size.  
While this setting makes it a bit easier for us older folks to read  
text on today's larger high resolution monitors, it also produces  
this unexpected negative side effect in Excel.  So the solution is  
fairly easy -- just go back to your desktop font setting, reset to  
the normal 96 bpi font size (which will require you to reboot your  
computer), then you should be able to successfully export your entry  
list correctly.  Afterwards you can then reset the font if wish.  The  
path to this particular setting is as follows -- 
 
     Control Panel / Display / Settings / Advanced 
 
 

 Cut-n-Paste Rows -- Excel 101 
 ============================= 
 
 
The most common Excel data manipulation activity the user of this  
Registration Template will face, is how to copy or move a line of  
skier data from one place in your the template, to another place, 
possibly even in a different tab section. 
 
Excel offers several ways whereby you can accomplish this, but we'll 
describe what we feel is the simplest and most robust method.  This 
is the "Cut" (or Copy) and "Insert Cut Cells" method. 
 
The process involves two steps.  First you go to the spot in the  
list where you find the row(s) that you want to move (or copy) to  
the active area at the top of the section you are working on.  If 
that involves more than one adjacent row, then first you'll need to  
highlight the RANGE of rows that you intend to move.  To highlight  
such a range of rows, put the mouse pointer over the row number of  
the top row of the range, then press and hold the left mouse button,  
then drag the mouse pointer down across the additional row numbers  
you want, until all are highlighted.  Then release the left mouse  
button, and that group of lines should stay highlighted.  Then put  
the mouse pointer back over one of the rows in the range, and then  
click the right mouse button (right click), which will open up an  
operations choice list.  Then click on the CUT option.  That range of  
lines should then appear surrounded by a rapidly-blinking border. 
 
If you have just one single line that you need to move, then all 
you need to do is to place the mouse pointer over the row number 
at the left border of that row, and then right click, then choose 
CUT (or COPY) from the operations choice list that pops up.  That  
line should then appear surrounded by a rapidly-blinking border. 
 
The line(s) of data you intend to move have now been placed on the 
windows "Clipboard", even though you can still see the data at the 
original position.  The blinking border indicates that this area 
will later disappear, once you tell Excel where to move that data. 
 
Then the second step is to show Excel where you want to insert the 
line(s).  That may be in the same tab section, or might be in an 
entirely different tab section -- either is perfectly OK.  So go 
to the area of the tab section where you want to insert that line, 
and then place the mouse pointer on the row number of the line 
where you want the new line(s) to go.  The operation which Excel 
will then carry out will move the existing data on that line, and 
on all of the lines below it, down by the number of lines that you 
are inserting at that row. 
 
Then right click on that row number, and you should find an INSERT 
CUT CELLS option in the operations choice pop-up box.  Click that 
choice, and the data lines previously cut should appear at that 
line, and all the other lines obligingly move down accordingly. 
 
That's all there is to it.  A couple of times through this exercise 
and you'll find this is very easy to carry out.
