<p>Several new functions have been implemented for 2011, which collectively 
provide support for Online Team Registration for NCWSA Tournaments.&nbsp; 
These permit the Team Captain (or other representative) to manage a Roster 
of Team Members for their particular NCWSA Team.&nbsp; Then the Captain can
build and edit Skier Rotation Plans for the active skiers in their Roster, 
for entry of that Team of skiers to particular NCWSA tournaments.&nbsp; 
Each tournament a team enters will have a separate Rotation Plan for their 
skiers.&nbsp; If desired, a new Rotation Plan for an upcoming tournament 
can be copied from another existing Rotation Plan for that team from a 
previous tournament, and then modified as necessary.</p>

<p>Team members whose membership expiration date occurs before the date of
the tournament being planned for, may not be entered by their Captain.&nbsp; 
During the Rotation Plan editing process, the team captain will find any of 
their active team members whose membership isn't good will not allow rotation
selection.&nbsp; This rotation planning system has direct access to the live 
membership system tables, and so if a team member renews or upgrades their 
membership online, that updated membership status will be reflected on the 
roster planning screen immediately, after the captain refreshes that 
screen.</p>

<p>Once a Rotation Plan for an upcoming tournament has been validated and 
submitted to that tournament, the system will then send emails to each of 
those entered team members, advising them of the need to execute an online 
Event Waiver and Release.&nbsp; Those emails will each contain a response 
link, which when clicked, will take that member directly to an online form 
that will present a pre-defined Event Waiver document, for that member and 
for that particular event -- all they need to do is "Formalize" their 
acceptance of that waiver, and it will then be logged and filed.&nbsp; An 
email copy of that Waiver document will also be sent to the team member 
for their records.</p>

<p>Event waiver acceptance status for each entered team member is shown on
the plan display view, so that captains and team members can monitor the 
waiver acceptance progress of their respective members.&nbsp; That acceptance 
status will also be noted in the subsequent registration download, that the 
tournament Registrar will eventually obtain, so that the Registrar will know 
who, if anyone, will need to execute Event Waivers in paper document form 
onsite.</p>

<p>Once the tournament Registrar has downloaded their final and official
registration template, containing the details of the Entry and Rotation Plans
that have been submitted by the captains, the Registrar may then <b>Lock</b> 
further online entries for their tournament, so that the system will then 
prevent any subsequent online entries, or revisions to existing entries.&nbsp; 
Thereafter, captains will be referred to the Registrar at the tournament site.</p>


<table cellPadding=0 width=95%><tr>

<td Align="right"><a href="#TopTop">
<font size="2"><br><b>(back to top)</b></font></a></TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<p>The Roster Management module provides each NCWSA team captain with
the tools to manage their respective Roster of team members.&nbsp; New 
Members can be added to a team's roster, by looking them up from the 
USA Water Ski Membership Database.&nbsp; A prospective NCWSA team 
member <b><i>must</i></b> have an active membership in USA Water Ski, 
<b><i>before</i></b> they can be added to an NCWSA Team Roster.&nbsp; 
Team members who have actually participated in one or more Sanctioned 
NCWSA competitions will be permanently associated with that team, and 
cannot be removed from the team's roster.&nbsp; However, team members 
who are no longer actively participating anymore, can be placed into 
"Inactive" status.&nbsp; Inactive members will no longer appear in 
the tournament preparation listings for the team.</p>

<p>Initial Team Rosters have been built, for all NCWSA Teams who have 
had any active NCWSA tournament participation in the 2008 through 2010 
seasons.&nbsp; Those participants with NCWSA team scores reported 
during the 2010 calendar year, have initially been coded as "Active" 
status for that team, while those whose latest activity was in 2009 
or earlier have been coded as "Inactive".&nbsp; Going forwards, those 
rosters will be under the control of the team captains -- see the 
<b>Status *</b> and <b>Action</b> column descriptions below for more 
information on this subject.</p>

<p>Please notice the <b>Show Inactives</b> check box, which appears 
at the top of the Team Roster display.&nbsp; This check box controls 
whether the display will show inactive members or not.&nbsp; If you 
can't find a team member who you are sure ought to be present, then 
be sure to check that Show Inactives box, and see if they're present 
but in the inactive status.&nbsp; If so, then just click the re-
activate button in the Action column, and that will switch them.&nbsp;
At the beginning of each season, the captain will probably find some
skiers in their roster who are no longer actively participating with
the team -- those members can be switched to inactive status, just
click the de-activate action button for each of them, and that will
switch them to inactive status, and they will no longer show up in
the active roster display or rotation planning screens.</p>

<p>Please note from this discussion that an NCWSA skier who has skied
for more than one team, will be listed in the Roster for <b><i>each</i></b> 
of those teams.&nbsp; Should such an individual sign onto the system to 
act as a captain, they will be in active status for that team which they 
skied for most recently.&nbsp; In the long run, these rosters and the
associated activity footprints, can be used by NCWSA officials for 
tracking participation and eligibility.</p>

<p>Here are some additional insights into the particulars that you 
will find in the Team Roster Display ...</p>

<p>The overall display is subdivided into two gender sections, with 
the Women's team skiers at the top, and the Men's team skiers at the 
bottom.&nbsp; Each section is presented in alphabetic order.&nbsp; 
Each row in the NCWSA Team Roster presents a number of attributes for 
that named team member.&nbsp; Column-by-column, here is a brief 
explanation on each of those elements:</p>

<ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>MemberID:</b></font>&nbsp; This is the team
member's USA Water Ski membership number, which matches that shown on
their annual membership card.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Member Name:</b></font>&nbsp; Displays the
member's name, exactly as it appears in the USA Water Ski membership
database.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<a name="MemEmail"></a>
<li><font color="blue"><b>Member eMail Address:</b></font>&nbsp; The eMail
address carried in the Membership system will display in a pop-up box, when
your mouse is held over a team member's Name field.&nbsp; We have found that 
a number of NCWSA skiers have their membership handled for them by Mom/Dad,
and as a result, the eMail address for that student may actually be Mom/Dad's
eMail address, rather than that of the team member themselves.&nbsp; That
can be a problem.&nbsp; Therefore, when first reviewing their roster each 
season, Captains should check those email addresses for all of their team
members, to be sure they have their personal contact email on file with 
USA Waterski, rather than Mom/Dad's.&nbsp; The <b>Update my Membership 
Info</b> link available on the Member's Only area menu brings up a form
where those details can be revised by the team member.&nbsp; However, be 
aware that this form does <b><i>not</i></b> instantaneously change the 
membership system tables -- rather this form submits the information to the 
HQ membership staff, who must manually enter the changes.&nbsp; So changes
here will not be instantaneous.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>City & State:</b></font>&nbsp; Displays 
the city and state of the address which the member supplied (or confirmed)
when they most recently renewed their membership with USA Water Ski.&nbsp;
Most college students are problematic with addresses, since they may choose
to list their school address rather than their home address -- that's where
their copy of <b>The Water Skier</b> magazine will be mailed.&nbsp; This 
is listed for information only.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Age / Gender:</b></font>&nbsp; The age 
shown is derived from the Birthdate supplied (or confirmed) when they 
most recently renewed their membership with USA Water Ski.&nbsp; 
While the age is really irrelevant here, the gender coding however 
is <b><i>very</i></b> important, and of course controls whether a 
particular member will be placed in the events for the Men's team or 
the Women's team.&nbsp; If you find one of your team members coded 
incorrectly as to gender, then you should have that individual 
contact the Membership department at USA Water Ski quickly, and get
that corrected.&nbsp; Please note that it can take up to 24 hours for
new membership enrollments, or changes to birthdate/gender changes 
like these, to find their way upstream into the tables which exist 
on the Website server, which is where the roster management process 
gets most of its information.&nbsp; Renewals or upgrades or other 
membership <b><i>status</i></b> changes, which are accomplished 
by members themselves through the online system, will 
however be reflected immediately.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Status *:</b></font>&nbsp; This column displays 
the <b>Team Status</b> of each individual team member.&nbsp; Please note
that the <b>USA Water Ski Membership Status</b> for each team member is
indicated in the <b>Notes</b> column immediately to the right, details of
which are explained below.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Those members who 
are no longer actively participating in competitions with the team, may 
be placed into Inactive Status -- see the <b>Action</b> column buttons 
described below.&nbsp; You will note that there is a checkbox marked 
<b>Show Inactives</b> at the top of the form -- this setting controls
whether inactive team members will be shown in the listing or not.&nbsp;
If you hold your mouse pointer over the status column for a particular
team member, that will pop up a box that will show some event statistics
for that individual, including the date of their earliest competition,
the date of their most recent, and the total number of competitions for
which we have NCWSA scores for that member, and their current Primary
Sports Division preference, that has been declared in the USA Water Ski
membership system.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If you see two red asterisks following the status for one of your team
members, that indicates the member has <b><i>not</i></b> declared NCWSA
as their primary <b>Sports Division</b>, in the USA Water Ski membership
system.&nbsp; You should be aware that the allocation of funds by USA
Water Ski to the respective Sports Divisions, is done based on tallies
of members by their primary Sports Division preference -- which is
normally noted in passing only during initial enrollments, or during 
the member's annual renewal.&nbsp; Your non-NCWSA team skiers can get 
this changed, by going to the <b>Update my Membership Info</b> link, 
found in the Member's Only area menu, on the USA Water Ski  
website.&nbsp; They may then change their sports division declaration, 
specified in the drop-downs near the bottom of the form.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Note(s):</b></font>&nbsp; This column 
indicates important information about a team member's status with 
respect to USA Water Ski, and might show <b>OK</b>, or might say, 
<b>No eMail</b>, or <b>Needs Renewal</b>, or <b>Needs Upgrade</b>, 
or <b>Needs Annual Waiver</b>, or could show some combination 
of these.&nbsp; These are all indications of existing
problems which would not allow that member to be entered by the Team,
and hence which the member ought to rectify as soon as possible.&nbsp; 
Since email communication is central to the administration of NCWSA Team 
registration, team members without an email address on record with 
USA Water Ski cannot be communicated with.&nbsp; Captains should also
be aware that skiers may have Mom/Dad's eMail address on file rather
than their own -- see the discussion on <a href="#MemEmail">Member 
eMail Address</a> earlier in this section.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

Expired members of course are not eligible to compete, and for that 
matter should not participate in sanctioned team practices.&nbsp; So 
if you see any such conditions listed for one of your active members, 
then you should get that individual to resolve that membership issue, 
or get their email address into the system, as quickly as possible.&nbsp; 
As mentioned above, renewals or upgrades or other membership status 
changes, which are accomplished by members themselves through the 
online system, will be reflected on this display immediately. &nbsp;
<font color="red">However, it is important for Captains to recognize 
that entirely new USA Water Ski membership enrollments 
<b><i>will not</i></b> be available for addition to a Collegiate 
Team's Roster, until after 4 AM on the morning following when that 
enrollment is processed on the website.</font>&nbsp; Hence captains
should be sure that new team members have their Memberships in order
with USA Waterski, and included in their team roster, and with the
proper local contact eMail address, <b><i>before</i></b> they intend 
to prepare an Entry and Rotation plan for an upcoming tournament.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Beyond the codes noted above, team members whose membership is good 
on the current date, but who will be expiring within the next 3 weeks,
will be indicated by a note of <b>Expires mm/dd</b>.&nbsp; So it will
be helpful for the captain to remind such team members when they see
a membership expiration looming.&nbsp; If the captain is planning a
team entry for a tournament beyond a member's expiration date, the
Entry and Rotation Planning features of this system will not allow
that member to be entered for the team.&nbsp; Hence such a note in
the team roster listing, provides the captain with advance warning 
on these potential problems.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Please note that the <b>Annual Waiver</b> referred to here is the
one required by USA Water Ski each year, for any member in those 
membership categories which permit active competition participation
-- in contrast to Event Waivers, which this system helps execute.&nbsp;
See the material below on <a href="#EvtWaivrs">Event Waivers</a> for 
those details.&nbsp; The USA Water Ski Annual Waiver is normally 
executed as a byproduct of membership renewals or upgrade actions.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Action:</b></font>&nbsp; There will be a
button in this column, that will allow you to change the status of
that skier with respect to your Team.&nbsp; Team members who have
skied in one or more NCWSA competitions on behalf of your school,
may be either <b>Active</b> or <b>Inactive</b>.&nbsp; Each member
will have either a <b>DeActivate</b> or a <b>ReActivate</b> button,
which would reverse their current status.&nbsp; A team member in 
Active status, who does <b><i>not</i></b> have any scores recorded 
with your team, will also offer a <b>Remove</b> button.&nbsp; So 
if a captain finds that they have added the wrong individual as a 
member of their team by mistake, this is how the captain would get 
rid of them.

<p>These features enable the Team Captain to prepare or edit a Skier 
Entry and Rotation Plan for an upcoming NCWSA tournament, and then to 
submit that particular set of skiers and their respective rotations, 
to the Registrar for that tournament.&nbsp; This section presents 
information on the following key features of this module:</p>

<td Align="right"><a href="#Rotations">
<font size="2"><br><b>(bk to RotPlan)</b></font></a></TD>
</TR></TABLE>


<p>Entry to these Rotation Planning features is accomplished through 
the <b>Rotation Plans</b> button, which appears at the top of the NCWSA 
Team Roster display screen.&nbsp; Once the captain clicks this button,
that will take them to a screen which displays a list of upcoming
NCWSA Tournaments.&nbsp; The captain will then select the particular
tournament for which they wish to develop or view or revise their 
Entry and Rotation Plan, from that list.&nbsp; That tournament display 
will offer the visitor an appropriate Action button for each tournament, 
depending on various factors about that particular tournament.</p>

<p>If the team already has an existing Entry and Rotation Plan for a 
tournament, then there will be an action button that will take the visitor 
to a display of the details of that plan.&nbsp; That display screen will
show the details of the Rotations planned for all entered skiers for that 
team.&nbsp; If Online Entries are still being accepted for that tournament, 
then that detail screen will also offer a <b>Revise Plan</b> button, whereby 
the Captain can make any changes that they wish, and then validate and 
submit that revision.</p>

<p>If there is no existing plan for the team for an upcoming tournament, 
and if Online Registration for that event has been closed by the Registrar, 
then that closed status will be noted in the tournament list, instead of 
an action button.<p>

<p>Finally, where there is no existing plan for the team for that tournament, 
and Online entries are still being accepted, the captain will be offered an 
action button to Build a New Entry and Rotation Plan for that tournament.&nbsp; 
When that button is clicked, then the Captain will be offered a list of other 
recent tournament Rotation Plans for his team -- and he may then elect to 
copy the details of one of those earlier plans, to use as a starting 
point.&nbsp; Alternatively, he may select the <b>Entirely New Plan</b>
choice, which will take them into the Rotation Planning detail screen 
with no pre-existing choices.</p>


<table cellPadding=0 width=95%><tr>
<td Align="left"><font color="red" size="3">
<a name="RPDetails"></a><br><b>Planning Rotation Details</b></font></TD>
<td Align="right"><a href="#Rotations">
<font size="2"><br><b>(bk to RotPlan)</b></font></a></TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<p>Just like the overall Team Roster, the Rotation Plan display has
been subdivided, with Women's team skiers at the top, and Men's team
skiers at the bottom.&nbsp; Only those skiers in your roster who are
in <b>Active</b> status for your team will appear on the Rotation Plan
template screen.</p>

<p>Active team members without email addresses, or whose membership 
has expired before the date of the tournament for which you are 
planning (or who have other membership issues), will be listed, but 
will <b><i>not</i></b> be available for rotation assignment.&nbsp; 
Therefore, you might find skiers whose status was good last week,
may have expired in the week in between.&nbsp; Therefore you should 
not put off setting up your plan until the last minute -- at least 
look at your plan early in the week before an upcoming tournament, 
so that you can ensure that all of your team members have their 
memberships in order.&nbsp; You can always make revisions to the 
Rotation details of your plan, right up until the Rotation Plan 
filing deadline for that tournament.&nbsp; See the material on 
<a href="#RPTiming">Timing Issues</a> below for more details on 
this subject.</p>

<p>You may enter up to five A team skiers in each event, for each 
of your Women's and Men's teams.&nbsp; If the tournament you are 
planning for allows B Team skiers, then you may also enter up to
five B team skiers in each event as well.&nbsp; You make your entry 
selection for each skier in events they will ski, by clicking on
the appropriate choice in the respective event drop-down boxes, 
which appear under each of the three event columns on this form.</p>

<p>If the tournament allows AWSA skiers, and you have team members 
who are technically ineligible due to NCWSA eligibility rules, or
volunteer officials that are affiliated with your team which you 
want to indicate entries for, you can select the <b>Age Div</b>
choice for those folks.&nbsp; That will result in their being
scheduled with the B team skiers, but under their AWSA Age Division
code, rather than under the CM or CW division codes that appear
on all the other A or B team skiers.</p>

<p>NCWSA protocols recommend that you put your strongest skier
out in the last (5th) rotation in each event.&nbsp; As an aid to 
planning the allocation of your team members across the rotations 
for each event, this Rotation Planning form offers a magnifying 
glass icon located next to each event rotation selection drop
down box.&nbsp; Holding your mouse over that magnifying glass will 
show you the latest NCWSA event ranking score (if any) in that event, 
for that particular team member.&nbsp; Clicking that icon will open 
a separate browsing window, offering a detail display of all recent 
scores in that event for that skier.</p>


<table cellPadding=0 width=95%><tr>

<td Align="right"><a href="#Rotations">
<font size="2"><br><b>(bk to RotPlan)</b></font></a></TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<p>Once you have reviewed the details of your Rotation Plan, and
revised those to your satisfaction, the next step is to click the 
<b>Validate Plan</b> button, which you will find at the bottom of 
the Rotation Plan form.&nbsp; That will submit the entire form back 
to the website, where it will be analyzed in detail.&nbsp; Each of 
the Men's and Women's team Rotation Plans will be separately 
reviewed and analyzed, for both duplications and for omissions.&nbsp; 
The results of that analysis for both teams is then 
presented in a recap screen.</p>

<p>Any rotation duplicates that are identified, will be noted in the 
recap line at the bottom of that event column for that respective team 
section.&nbsp; The second occurrance of any such duplicated rotation 
choice, will appear highlighted in red, in the plan details above.</p>

<p>Rotation omissions -- rotation slots to which there is no skier assigned 
-- will also be identified and listed in that recap.&nbsp; For teams 
who are unable to field a complete roster of five skiers for each event, 
omissions may not necessarily represent mistakes.&nbsp; But for those 
teams who <b><i>do</i></b> intend to enter a full set of five skiers in 
an event, any skips identified by the validation process, would help you 
eliminate such errors.</p>

<p>If your review of that recap leads you to want to make any revisions
to your plan, then you would click the <b>Revise Plan</b> button that
appears at the bottom of the recap.&nbsp; If duplications were detected, 
then the <b>Submit Plan</b> button will be disabled; revising your plan 
to eliminate those duplications would be the only proper course.</p>

</TR></TABLE>

<p>Once you (and the system) are satisfied with the details of your 
Rotation Plan, you would then click the <b>Submit Plan</b> button, 
which appears at the bottom of the recap.&nbsp; That will submit the 
details of your Entry and Rotation Plan to the Registrar for that 
tournament.</p>

<p>That plan submission will also generate an eMail to each entered 
team member, advising them of the need to execute an Event Waiver and 
Release form, with respect to their participation in that tournament.&nbsp; 
Rather than having each participant have to fill out and sign a paper 
document at the tournament site, it is much easier for all concerned 
for the entrants to execute those Waiver and Release forms through the 
Online system, beforehand.&nbsp; That email note to each participant 
will offer them a link, which will take them directly to the Online 
Waiver management function, for that particular individual, and for 
that particular tournament.&nbsp; See the material on 
<a href="#EvtWaivrs">Event Waivers</a> below for more
details on this subject.</p>

<p>Please note that if a captain submits a revised plan, that such eMails 
are only generated for those entered team skiers who had <b><i>not</i></b> 
previously been eMailed a Waiver notice request with respect to this 
particular tournament.</p>

<p>Online team entries can only be prepared and submitted as long as 
the Registrar leaves the Online Registration Status <b>Open</b>.&nbsp;
That Open/Closed Status is controlled by the Registrar from within the
<b>Registration Download</b> administrative area.&nbsp; Once the 
Registrar downloads their final and official Registration Template
-- an Excel workbook containing all of the online entry and rotation
information submitted by the various team captains -- the Registrar 
will then <b>Close</b> that tournament, and the Online Entry system
thereafter will no longer allow new entries, or further revisions to
existing entries.&nbsp; Instead, captains will be directed to contact
the Registrar at the Tournament site.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the tournament Registrar -- and other 
visitors -- may at any time view the registration status of Teams for 
any upcoming NCWSA tournament, using the <b>Registrar Tools</b> button 
under the <b>Collegiate Registration</b> menu heading.&nbsp; Given the 
above control protocol, and the fact that last-minute changes can arise 
as late as Friday afternoon, as teams are packing up to travel to the 
tournament, it is therefore recommended that the Registrar pull that 
final download and close the tournament no earlier than say 5:00 PM on
Friday afternoon, so that such last-minute changes can be included
in their download.&nbsp; If Internet access dynamics or other factors 
dictate that the registration for a particular tournament needs to be 
closed at an earlier point in time, then that should be noted in the
tournament announcement so that team captains will be aware of that
earlier deadline.</p>

</TR></TABLE>

<p>The framework for participants to accept Event Waiver and
Release forms, which are now required for all USA Water Ski
sanctioned events, in advance, through the online system, is
one of the major process simplifying benefits of this new 
system.&nbsp; Here is how this will work ...</p>

<ol>

<li>The team captain will prepare their Team Entry and Rotation Plan 
for a tournament, then once that plan is validated, the captain will
submit that as the Team Entry for that tournament.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The system will then send a customized eMail notice to each of the
entered team members.&nbsp; Each of those eMail notices will notify
the entered team member of their entry into the tournament, and provide
them a customized link through which they can execute their Waiver online.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>When the entered team member clicks the link in their customized
eMail notice, they will be taken directly to an online Event Waiver 
and Release Form, specific to that particular tournament, and for that 
particular team participant.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>If an entered team member loses that Event Waiver email notice, or 
their email client does not support such active links in incoming emails,
the team member can use the <b>Individual Event Waivers</b> link -- under
the <b>Collegiate Registration</b> menu item offered in the Member's Only
area -- to select and execute any outstanding Event Waivers for events 
into which that team member has been entered.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Clicking the <b>I Accept</b> button on that online Waiver form,
will record that acceptance in the system, and will also send a 
confirmation copy of the executed Waiver and Release form, back to 
that participant.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The online display of the Entry and Rotation Plan for a tournament,
includes a Waiver Status indicator for each entered skier, and so the 
captain or the team members themselves can monitor their status in this 
regard, up until they pack up to head for the tournament.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The online registration reports -- offered through the <b>Registrar
Tools</b> link that appears under the <b>Collegiate Registration</b>
menu item -- will contain tallies of the numbers of entered teams and
skiers, and of the number of those entered skiers who have executed
their Event Waivers.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The final Registration Download -- an Excel workbook that is 
downloaded by the Registrar -- will then indicate which of the 
entered skiers have already done their Waivers online.&nbsp; So 
they would only need to get those -- hopefully few -- stragglers 
to do paper Waiver forms at the tournament site.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<p>The most significant changes are that the four Tab sections of the 
registration template will now include the skier rotation information,
collected from the Rotation Plans that are submitted by the respective 
Team Captains.&nbsp; Additionally, the "Ready to Ski" column will now 
also contain indications of whether each skier has executed their Event
Waiver online or not, so that they will know who they will have to 
obtain paper waiver documents from.</p>

<p>There is also interaction now between the Rotation Plan preparation 
and modification modules, and the registration download processes, such 
that once the Registrar has pulled their "Final and Official" version 
of the registration template, further modifications to those rotation 
plans will no longer be allowed online.&nbsp; See the material on 
<a href="#RPTiming">Timing Issues</a> above for more details on this 
subject.</p>

<p>Finally, Registrars should be aware that the Excel Registration
Download workbook now contains an new REGISTRAR tab section.&nbsp;
This new section is designed to make it lots easier for the Registrar 
to figure total team entry fees, and to see exactly which entered 
skiers still need to execute Event Waivers onsite, on paper forms.
&nbsp; This new section was developed specifically for the needs of 
Registrars.&nbsp; The four primary Divisional tab sections -- Men 
(A tm), Women (A tm), Men (B tm) and Women (B tm) -- are there for 
exporting the entry information for input to the DOS WSTIMS scoring 
program.&nbsp; However, this new REGISTRAR section is also expected 
to serve as the input to the new WSTIMS for Windows scoring program, 
once that has been approved for official use by NCWSA.</p>
